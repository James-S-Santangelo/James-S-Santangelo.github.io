intro:
  - excerpt: '_I recently completed my PhD in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto working with [Marc Johnson](https://evoecolab.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Rob Ness](https://www.ness.bio){:target="_blank"} where I used urban environments as large-scale, naturally replicated environments to examine the extent of parallel phenotypic and genomic evolution in nature using white clover (Trifolium repens) as a model system. I am currently a postdoc with [Rasmus Nielsen](https://nielsen-lab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} where I am investigating genome-wide signatures of natural selection associated with urbanization and developing methods to estimate the strength of selection along environmental gradients using whole genome sequence data._'
