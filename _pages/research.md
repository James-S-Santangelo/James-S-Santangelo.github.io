    excerpt: "Early in my PhD, I helped collect ~12,000 white clover (_Trifolium repens_) plants from 16 cities in eastern North America to quantify the extent to which cities drive the [repeated evolution of hydrogen cyanide](https://ln.sync.com/dl/cbbe249a0/76y3h6gg-q8xu7ei4-4krtps7d-6rwwaqz8) (HCN—an anti-herbivore defense). I am currently co-leading the [Global Urban Evolution Project (GLUE)](http://www.globalurbanevolution.com/), a collaborative effort from ~300 scientists around the world aiming to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of urbanization on a global scale. Current experimental work is exploring whether urban environments drive the [evolution of multiple, correlated traits.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/699017v2)"
